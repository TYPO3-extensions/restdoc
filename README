1) Install this extension as usual.

2) Generate your reST documentation using Sphinx as JSON:

$ cd /path/to/documentation
$ make json

3) Copy build/json to your TYPO3 website (e.g., fileadmin/rest/).

4) Add a plugin to your page and give the path to your reST documentation.

5) Enjoy

Remark 1: the main documentation file should be index.fjson.
Remark 2: this is a work in progress :)
