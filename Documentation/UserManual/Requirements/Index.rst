Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You need a documentation written in reStructuredText and as a Sphinx project. Please visit http://wiki.typo3.org/ReST for further information. You may consider using TYPO3 extension Sphinx to easily set up your environment.

The main documentation file should be named ``index.rst``. If you choose to use the FLOW3 coding guidelines and name it ``Index.rst`` or want to use another arbitrary name, make sure to update the default TypoScript settings accordingly.
